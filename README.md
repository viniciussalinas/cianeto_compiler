# Cianeto Compiler
This compiler was developed as part of the "Laboratório de Compiladores" course at the Universidade Federal de São Carlos (UFSCar). It's designed to process Cianeto source code, providing features for code analysis, error reporting, and, if needed, Java code generation.

## Usage
To compile a Cianeto source code file, use the following command:

```java comp.Comp input```

Where input is the file or directory you wish to compile. The compiler will generate a detailed report, including error information and other relevant details.

## Report
The compiler generates a comprehensive report summarizing the compilation process. It categorizes errors into different classes (e.g., Very Important, Important, Little Important) and provides insights into the compiler's ability to detect issues in the source code.

For a full overview of the compilation process and test results, consult the "report.txt" file.
